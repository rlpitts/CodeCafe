    "A \"class\" is essentially a template for 1) creating and describing of variable, and 2) controlling how that variable can be manipulated. The descriptors associated with all objects of a given class are called \"attributes\". Functions defined within the class definition, which can operate on any object of a given class once it is created (and only on objects of that class), are called \"methods\". When we talk about classes, we call individual examples of the class \"instances.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's one of those things that's much easier to show than to explain. Keep an eye out for the terms class, attribute, method, and instance, and how I use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run Python 3 (as I hope most of you are), a Python class is the same as a data type, which means that integers, floats, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and Boolean values are all classes as well. For Python 2.7 and earlier, types and classes were distinguishable by the fact that Python \"types\" were also built-in types in C, which is the language of the code running your Python interpreter from behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unification of class and type has the mildly amusing effect of making the type of any class \"type\"."
