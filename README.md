Jupyter Notebook tutorials for Code and Coffee seminar series I hosted

This was a weekly series where we had speakers around 30-50% of the time, so I was far from the only contributor. The ipynb files posted here are only my own contributions so far. I have others' tutorials on file, but it'd be better if they posted them as shared contributions.
