Jupyter Notebook tutorials for Code and Coffee seminar series I hosted.

This was a weekly series where we had speakers around 30-50% of the time, so I was far from the only contributor. The ipynb files posted here are only my own contributions so far. I have others' tutorials on file, but it'd be better if they posted them as shared contributions.

Note that the first half of the Intro to Emcee notebook is literally just the same notebook they let you download from the official Emcee site. I just extended it to a case that cropped up in my own research to show others in my field how that might look. I know when I was first trying to learn this stuff, I spent a long time confused about the form of the log-likelihood function and how generally applicable it was.
